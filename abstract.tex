\begin{abstract}
  Emacs is the world's greatest editor---at least its proponents think
  so.  One of its chief appeals is that it is \emph{programmable} via
  its own programming language, Emacs Lisp, a Lisp in the classic
  tradition.  Its core has remained remarkably stable since its
  inception in 1981.  Still, Emacs Lisp has evolved and continues to
  do so.

  Despite the fact that it is closely tied to a concrete editor, Emacs
  Lisp has spawned multiple implementations---in Emacs itself but also
  in variants of Emacs, such as XEmacs and Edwin.  Through competing
  implementations as well as changes in maintainership, it has picked
  up outside influences over the years, most notably from Common Lisp.
  Important aspects of Emacs Lisp's  have been shaped by
  concrete \emph{requirements} of the editor it supports, most
  visibly in \textit{buffer-local variables} that tie binding to
  editor buffers.
  These requirements led to the choice of a Lisp dialect as Emacs's
  language in the first place, specifically its dynamic nature.
  Loading additional Emacs packages or changing the ones in place
  occurs frequently, and having to to restart the editor in order to
  re-compile or re-link the code would be unacceptable.  Fulfilling
  this requirement in a more static language would have been difficult
  at best.

  Emacs Lisp has also picked up some ideas from principled
  programming-language design as well, notably lexical scoping,
  through the involvement of programming-language researchers with
  Emacs maintainership.
  One of Lisp's chief characteristics is its malleability through its
  uniform syntax and the use of macros.  This has allowed the core to
  change only slowly while enabling Emacs packages to provide new
  surface syntax.  In particular, Emacs Lisp can be customized to look
  much like Common Lisp, and additional packages provide object
  systems, legible regular expressions, and FIXME Stefan.
  One area where, maybe surprisingly, Emacs Lisp has not picked up
  "`principled design concepts"' is modularity, despite the fact that
  Emacs constitutes a fairly large ecosystem of packages with several
  million lines of code.  Instead, Emacs Lisp relies on social
  mechanisms to achieve composability of packages. This, combined
  Emacs Lisp's dynamic nature, have produced a remarkably robust
  system that continues to function even in the face of unexpected
  exceptions.

  While we highlight these technical aspects of Emacs Lisp, we trace
  its development chronologically. The timeline of Emacs Lisp
  development is closely tied to the projects and people who have
  shaped it over the years: We document Emacs Lisp history through its
  predecessors, Mocklisp and MacLisp, its early development up the
  "`Emacs schism"' and the fork of Lucid Emacs, the development of
  XEmacs, and the subsequent rennaissance of Emacs development.  When
  it makes sense, we tie in with the evolution of Lisp in general.
