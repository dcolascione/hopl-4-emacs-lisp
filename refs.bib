  abstract =     {This paper introduces a new metaobject, the generalizer,
                  which complements the existing specializer metaobject.
                  With the help of examples, we show that this metaobject
                  allows for the efficient implementation of complex
                  non-class-based dispatch within the framework of existing
                  metaobject protocols.  We present our modifications to the
                  generic function invocation protocol from the Art of the
                  Metaobject Protocol; in combination with previous work,
                  this produces a fully-functional extension of the existing
                  mechanism for method selection and combination, including
                  support for method combination completely independent from
                  method selection.  We discuss our implementation, within
                  the SBCL implementation of Common Lisp, and in that
                  context compare the performance of the new protocol with
                  the standard one, demonstrating that the new protocol can
                  be tolerably efficient.}
